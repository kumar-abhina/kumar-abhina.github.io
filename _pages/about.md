Hi! I am Abhinav, a **Masters in Robotics** student with a focus on **reinforcement learning** and **robotic manipulation** at **[Northeastern University](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-robotics-17772/){:target="\_blank"}**. I completed my Bachelor's in **Robotics Engineering** from **[SRM University](https://example.com){:target="\_blank"}**, India. My passion for intelligent systems and autonomous robots inspired me to delve deeper into these cutting-edge technologies.

I am currently conducting research in **mobile manipulation and long-horizon tasks**, combining **Reinforcement Learning**, **deep learning**, and **motion planning** to allow robot to perform complex manipulation task in unseen and unstructured Environment. My recent projects include working with **Immataion Learning with few shot demostration**, and exploring **reinforcement learning frameworks** for robotic decision-making.I am currently working under Professor Platt at Northeastern University at **[Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/){:target="\_blank"}**

I aspire to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve by integrating advanced control systems, perception, and RL techniques. From automating pick-and-place tasks to building cloud-connected robotic platforms, I aim to develop intelligent systems that transform the way we interact with the world.
